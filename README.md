## machine-learning-coursera
This repository contains all the exercises/assignments I did while completing my <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning Course of Stanford University</a> through Coursera under Professor Andrew NG.<br>
<i>All the assignments are done in `GNU Octave`</i>
